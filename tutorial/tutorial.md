# Set Up

1. Open up Git Bash (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux). Type the following commands (press enter between each) to set your name and email. Change "Your Name" and "Your Email" to your actual name and email, or whatever you would like displayed alongside your commits.
`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

`git config --global user.email "Your Email"`

# Create a Repo
There are multiple ways you might initiate a local git repository:
1. Create a new repository locally (that you might ultimately track remotely).
2. Create a new repository on the remote server (e.g., Github).
3. Clone an existing repostory on Github, either yours or someone else's.

We're actually going to do this the second way, because then we can also get familiar with Github, and it is (in my opinion) a little easier to set up.

1. Go to [Github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository by clicking the green "New" button on the left side.
2. Give your new repo a fun name! Git will suggest one; take its suggestion by clicking on the green text after "How about...?"
3. Make sure your repo is public and check "Add a README file" under the Initialize header. Create your repository.





Branch protection:
You can create a branch protection rule in a repository for a specific branch, all branches, or any branch that matches a name pattern you specify with fnmatch syntax. For example, to protect any branches containing the word release, you can create a branch rule for *release*.
